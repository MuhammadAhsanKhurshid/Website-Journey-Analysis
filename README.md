In this project, my main focus was on Data Cleaning and Analysis. The tables I had to work with were a bit messy initially â€“ the raw data used by the 365 data science platform. One significant issue was the "journey" column, which was unclear and hindered any meaningful analysis. To tackle this, I used Functions and Loops to clean it up, making the data usable.
Once the data was sorted, I delved into some interesting analyses. I identified the user with the highest number of visits and explored whether these visits were linked to coupons, discounted offers, or something else. Additionally, I looked into the role of subscriptions, mapping out the paths users took to get an annual subscription. I spiced up the findings with visualizations for a clearer understanding and wrapped things up with some nuanced analyses to add depth to the project.
